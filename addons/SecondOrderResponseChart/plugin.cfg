name="SecondOrderDynamics"
description="A plugin designed for Godot 4.3 that allows users to work with complex second-order systems.
 It integrates a line chart directly into the inspector to visualize the system's response over time.
This tool simplifies the analysis and tuning of second-order dynamics, providing a clear graphical representation
 of the system's behavior, such as oscillations, damping, and natural frequency, all within the editor."
